It exceeded our expectations even! It was a beautiful house and we all loved the master bathroom with what I called ""The Rain Shower""! I have never seen anything like it and it was just superb! The master suite was also very gorgeous and we used the sitting area to stage the bridal party and bride's ""getting ready for the wedding"" pictures. The stained glass was spectacular and so was the staircase. I can't wait to get pictures back from the photographer because the house was just fantastic! We also appreciated the back porch/mud room, especially to store stuff for the wedding. And I thought the kitchen was perfect and loved cooking in there! I would definitely stay again and I so appreciate your willingness to work with us and your prompt responses and making sure everything was fine when we got there. Thank you so much!

The home is comprised of 7 shipping containers with an added greenhouse & rooftop deck overlooking the city skyline. The floor to ceiling windows on the first & second floor both face & provide a unique perspective of Fall Creek River. The home has a large back yard. Plenty of comics, action figures & games to keep you entertained throughout your stay.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />The first floor is an open layout which houses the kitchen, dining room & living room. As you walk in, you will notice the mellow greyscale paint scheme, black lighting fixtures, dark grey cabinetry & stunning black granite counters. The whites & greys flowing through the granite counters resembles a glimpse into the cosmos. The floor to ceiling windows on the first floor bring a ton of natural light into this bat cave like area. You will notice two skateboard decks by renowned artists, Takashi Murakami & Felipe Pantone. The pop culture art helps to bring some pops of color to this home. You are being watched by the Joker in the living room... so behave. The living room sofa, surrounding sofa chairs & 65"" TV all help to create a perfect movie spot for the group. <br /><br />The slatted woodwork is the highlight of the custom staircase as you head up to the second floor. There are two bedrooms, a greenhouse & a shared full bathroom on the second floor. Each bedroom is fitted with a 14"" memory foam mattress & floating headboard. The bedrooms in The Gotham all feature pop culture art. Try to point out every movie, show & game that you recognize. Can you get them all?! Also, don't forget to take advantage of the lava lamps during your nighttime reading. <br /><br />My favorite feature of this container home is the greenhouse overlooking Fall Creek. The greenhouse is stocked with plenty of tropical plants which makes for the perfect urban jungle. The 40 ft, 8 ft wide greenhouse provides seating for 6, a yoga mat, a record player, record collection as well as action figures, nerf guns & plenty of comic books. Grab a record & a comic book and truly relax as you enjoy Fall Creek & this natural green escape in downtown Indy. Fall Creek is home to many bird species & animals in general. I am extremely fond of the blue herons, hawks & occasional bald eagle. I've also seen deer, groundhogs, turtles & one coyote. Let me know what you see. <br /><br />Take your time heading up the diagonal spiral staircase as you enter the entertainment space on the 3rd floor right outside of the master bedroom. This entertainment space is decked out with 2 digital pinball machines, a Nintendo 64 & a stellar BluRay collection if I do say so myself (my old collection) to enjoy on the mounted 50"" TV. Have fun playing in the arcade & please let me know if you are able to crack my high score on Spiderman... it'll be tough. <br /><br />Lastly, head on up to the 480 sq. ft. rooftop deck with seating for 9 and 360 degree views of downtown Indianapolis. It is truly an incredible vantage point of the city skyline, nearby neighborhoods & of course, Fall Creek. The rooftop is fitted with grass turf which makes it comfortable to walk on, do some yoga or hit an early morning workout.<br /><br />Proximity to popular destinations:<br /><br />Convention Center -> 3.8 miles<br />Bottleworks District -> 1.9 miles<br />Lucas Oil Stadium -> 4.1 miles<br />Gainbridge Fieldhouse -> 3.4 miles<br />Old National/Egyptian Room -> 2.5 miles<br />Fairgrounds -> 1.8 miles<br />Indianapolis Motor Speedway -> 5.9 miles<br />Broad Ripple -> 4.4 miles<br />TCU Amphitheater -> 4.3 miles<br />Fountain Square -> 4 miles<br />Ruoff Music Center -> 19 miles<br /><br />Please ask about any venue & I will let you know the proximity.<br /><br /><b>Guest access</b><br />You have access to the entire home & you will be given 3 designated parking spots.<br /><br /><b>Other things to note</b><br />NO PARTIES.

It is one of three container homes located on the lot. The home is comprised of 7 shipping containers with an added greenhouse & rooftop deck. The floor to ceiling windows on the first & second floor both face & provide a unique perspective of Fall Creek River. The rooftop deck provides a view of the city skyline as well as scenic views of the river, nearby bridges & green canopy.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />The first floor is an open layout which houses the kitchen, dining room & living room. As you walk into The Marley, you will immediately feel the earthy tones. From the light green walls to the grey speckled granite & natural wood grain cabinets, you will feel a deeper connection to the natural elements of this space. The floor to ceiling windows help to illuminate the earthy & positive vibrations. The dining room features two standout art pieces. First, the red orb, which I view as the 'heartbeat of the home', was completed by local Indy artist, Stuart Alter. Second, the 5 skateboard decks featuring Andy Warhol's famous skull. Both help to add some color & soul to the space. The living room seats 7 comfortably & includes a mounted 65"" TV. If you get too comfortable here, that's okay. The green sofa converts to sleeper sofa. <br /><br />The slatted woodwork is the highlight of the custom staircase as you head up to the second floor. There are two bedrooms, a greenhouse & a shared full bathroom on the second floor. You will notice plenty of animal art spread out between the hallways & bedrooms. The canvas' were captured by myself back in 2012 & the vibrant framed prints are from renowned Pittsburgh artist, Baron Batch. Each bedroom is fitted with a medium firm memory foam mattress & floating headboard. <br /><br />My favorite feature of this container home is the greenhouse overlooking Fall Creek. The greenhouse is stocked with plenty of tropical plants which makes for the perfect urban jungle. The 40 ft long, 8 foot wide greenhouse provides seating for 6, a yoga mat, a record player & other fun touches. You will notice all the trinkets from my trips to Africa. Those trips definitely helped to inspire the vibe of this home. Grab the Bob Marley record & enjoy this pocket of nature & greenery in downtown Indy. Fall Creek is home to many bird species & animals in general. I am extremely fond of the blue herons, hawks & occasional bald eagle. I've also seen deer, groundhogs, turtles & one coyote. Let me know what you see. <br /><br />Take your time heading up the diagonal spiral staircase as you enter the entertainment space on the 3rd floor right outside of the master bedroom. Chill out in the sofa chairs & watch some TV on the 50"" flatscreen or play some shuffleboard if you're feeling competitive. The master bedroom includes a 14"" memory foam Queen mattress as well as a fully tiled shower & bathroom. <br /><br />Lastly, head on up to the 480 sq. ft. rooftop deck with seating for 9 and 360 degree views of downtown Indianapolis. It is truly an incredible vantage point of the city skyline, nearby neighborhoods & of course, Fall Creek. The rooftop is fitted with grass turf which makes it comfortable to walk on, do some yoga or hit an early morning workout.<br /><br />Proximity to popular destinations:<br /><br />Convention Center -> 3.8 miles<br />Bottleworks District -> 1.9 miles<br />Lucas Oil Stadium -> 4.1 miles<br />Gainbridge Fieldhouse -> 3.4 miles<br />Old National/Egyptian Room -> 2.5 miles<br />Fairgrounds -> 1.8 miles<br />Indianapolis Motor Speedway -> 5.9 miles<br />Broad Ripple -> 4.4 miles<br />TCU Amphitheater -> 4.3 miles<br />Fountain Square -> 4 miles<br />Ruoff Music Center -> 19 miles<br /><br />Please ask about any venue & I will let you know the proximity.<br /><br /><b>Guest access</b><br />You have access to the entire home & you will be given 3 designated parking spots.<br /><br /><b>Other things to note</b><br />NO PARTIES. 0 tolerance.<br /><br /><b>Registration Details</b><br />SRP-000347",9,5 beds,5,2.5 baths,Boho Container Home - rooftop deck & greenhouse,Entire home/apt,Entire home/apt,73,Bathtub; Hair dryer; Cleaning products; Native or other high end brand shampoo; Native or other high end products conditioner; Native or other high end brand body soap; Hot water; Shower gel; Washer; Free dryer – In unit; Hangers; Bed linens; Room-darkening shades; Iron; Drying rack for clothing; Clothing storage; TV; Record player; Arcade games; Books and reading material; Theme room; Life size games; Air conditioning; Ceiling fan; Portable fans; Central heating; Exterior security cameras on property; Smoke alarm; Carbon monoxide alarm; Fire extinguisher; First aid kit; Wifi; Dedicated workspace; Kitchen; Refrigerator; Microwave; Cooking basics; Dishes and silverware; Freezer; Dishwasher; Stainless steel electric stove; Stainless steel single oven; Coffee maker: Keurig coffee machine; Wine glasses; Baking sheet; Dining table; Coffee; Waterfront; Private entrance; Private patio or balcony; Private backyard; Outdoor furniture; Outdoor dining area; Sun loungers; Free parking on premises; Luggage dropoff allowed; Long term stays allowed; Self check-in; Lockbox; Housekeeping - available at extra cost,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,73,15,15,0,4.87,4,27,27 Reviews in Q4,22,30.14,17,23.29,0,0,1,1.22E+18,39.806546,-86.145256,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,

This home provides comfortable beds, high end linens and a well stocked kitchen. Comfortable, cozy and a relaxing outdoor space that is amazing. I strive to keep my place very well maintained and DO NOT allow parties or events.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />When you stay at the Vintage Dream my number one emphasis is on cleanliness and free amenities such as a coffee bar, bottled water, popcorn, shampoo, conditioner and hand and body wash. I have traveled all over the world and know the little things that are important, after all when you travel it is the experience that makes the difference.<br /><br />The home has been updated with hardwood floors throughout. You will have access to the entire house including the basement which has an additional family room, queen bed, and a washer and dryer. There are beach towels in the hall closet. The Foyer doubles as a study with a printer that you can connect to via wifi.<br /><br />Guests have the entire house, pool, and fire pit on an acre and a half of land that is very private yet in the middle of the city convenient to restaurants and shopping. We go above and beyond to provide all of the amenities for comfortable and convenient stay! Starbucks is within walking distance or a very short drive.<br /><br />Additional guests: This home is setup for 6 guests. Any additional guest must have pre-approval prior to booking with a $25 per person/per night charge. If you do not have prior authorization you will be asked to leave with no refund. NO PARTIES OTHER THAN THE GUESTS STAYING AT THE PROPERTY!

Coastal contemporary theme with plenty of vintage touches. The home is comprised of 7 shipping containers with an added greenhouse & rooftop deck. There is plenty of yard space as well. The floor to ceiling windows on the first two floors provide beautiful views of the river. The rooftop deck provides a 360 degree view of downtown Indy.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />The first floor is an open layout which houses the kitchen, dining room & living room spaces. As you walk in, you will notice the rich contrast between the walnut flooring & stark quartzite counters partnered with custom white cabinets. The seashell dining room lights, boathouse bar lights & yarn lighting will make you feel cozy in this coastal escape. The floor to ceiling windows on the first floor help to illuminate this bright & cozy space. You will notice trinkets from worldly travels above the cabinetry as well as a Takashi Murakami art piece overlooking the dining room. The living room sofa chairs & sofa make for an extremely comfortable movie spot on the 65"" mounted TV. <br /><br />The slatted woodwork is the highlight of the custom stairs as you head up to the second floor. There are two bedrooms, a greenhouse & a shared full bathroom on the second floor. You can't miss the stunning custom art piece by Indy native, Stuart Alter, overlooking the stairs & second floor. This triptych piece captures everything from the Florida sunset to the pink flamingos to the deep ocean blues. At least thats how I interpret it... You will have to tell me how it makes you feel. Each bedroom is fitted with a medium firm memory foam 14"" mattress & floating headboard. Every bedroom in the Sycamore features artwork by world renowned artist, Shepard Fairey. The simple color schemes, blues & wooden framed blended perfectly with the coastal theme. I hope you enjoy them. <br /><br />My favorite feature of this container home is the greenhouse overlooking Fall Creek. The greenhouse is stocked with plenty of tropical plants which makes for the perfect urban jungle. The 40 foot long greenhouse is about 8 feet wide & provides seating for 6, a yoga mat, a record player, record collection, reading lights, trinkets from worldly travels & a couple other fun old school touches. Dive into the record collection & truly kick back & enjoy a pocket of nature & greenery in downtown Indy. Fall Creek is home to many bird species & animals in general. I am extremely fond of the blue herons, hawks & occasional bald eagles that visit. I've also seen some friendly groundhogs, snapping turtles & deer. Let me know what you see. <br /><br />Take your time heading up the diagonal spiral staircase as you enter the entertainment space on the third floor right outside of the master bedroom. Take it easy & watch the 50"" TV or use the card table & dive into some classic board games I have to offer. The third floor features more Murakami & Fairey artwork. The master bedroom includes a 14"" Queen size memory foam mattress as well as a fully tiled shower & bathroom. <br /><br />Lastly, head on up to the 480 sq. ft. rooftop deck with seating for 9 and 360 degree views of downtown Indianapolis. It is truly an incredible vantage point of the city skyline, nearby neighborhoods & of course, Fall Creek. The rooftop is fitted with grass turf which makes it comfortable to walk on, do some yoga or hit an early morning workout.<br /><br />Proximity to popular destinations:<br /><br />Convention Center -> 3.8 miles<br />Bottleworks District -> 1.9 miles<br />Lucas Oil Stadium -> 4.1 miles<br />Gainbridge Fieldhouse -> 3.4 miles<br />Old National/Egyptian Room -> 2.5 miles<br />Fairgrounds -> 1.8 miles<br />Indianapolis Motor Speedway -> 5.9 miles<br />Broad Ripple -> 4.4 miles<br />TCU Amphitheater -> 4.3 miles<br />Fountain Square -> 4 miles<br />Ruoff Music Center -> 19 miles<br /><br />Please ask about any venue & I will let you know the proximity.<br /><br /><b>Guest access</b><br />You have access to the entire home & you will be given 3 designated parking spots.<br /><br /><b>Other things to note</b><br />NO PARTIES. 0 tolerance.<br /><br /><b>Registration Details</b><br />SRP-000346",8,4 beds,4,2.5 baths,Coastal Container Home - rooftop deck & greenhouse,Entire home/apt,Entire home/apt,61,Bathtub; Hair dryer; Cleaning products; Native or other high end brand shampoo; Native or other high end brand conditioner; Native or other high end brand body soap; Hot water; Shower gel; Washer; Free dryer – In unit; Hangers; Bed linens; Room-darkening shades; Iron; Drying rack for clothing; Clothing storage: closet; TV; Record player; Books and reading material; Theme room; Board games; Air conditioning; Ceiling fan; Portable fans; Central heating; Exterior security cameras on property; Smoke alarm; Carbon monoxide alarm; Fire extinguisher; First aid kit; Wifi; Dedicated workspace; Kitchen; Refrigerator; Microwave; Cooking basics; Dishes and silverware; Freezer; Dishwasher; Stainless steel electric stove; Stainless steel single oven; Coffee maker: Keurig coffee machine; Wine glasses; Baking sheet; Dining table; Coffee; Waterfront; Private entrance; Private patio or balcony; Private backyard; Outdoor furniture; Outdoor dining area; Sun loungers; Free parking on premises; Pets allowed; Luggage dropoff allowed; Long term stays allowed; Self check-in; Lockbox; Housekeeping - available at extra cost,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,61,16,16,0,3.81,4,23,23 Reviews in Q4,14,22.95,11,18.03,14,22.95,0,1.22E+18,39.8066803,-86.14545909,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,

This house can do it all from family gatherings with kids to large friendly getaways. Our home is incredibly spacious & has endless seating arrangements to keep everyone comfortable. Each bedroom offers a king bed, and the master has an additional queen bed, crib, & infant amenities. There are two spacious full bathrooms upstairs & an additional washer/dryer. The attic is complete and boasts multiple sleeping options. Our kitchen is a great gathering area & is fully stocked.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />You know you have arrived as soon as you lay eyes on our newly renovated big blue home located under a canopy from our front yard tree. You will immediately see our covered front porch which is such a fun space to kick back and relax on. Once you enter your personal code on our electronic keypad you will be greeted with the perfect entryway to set your belongings. You will instantly view the majority of the first floor due to the open concept design.<br /><br />You will find the inside of our home to be extremely spacious and comfortable. The main floor is complete with two living rooms, a dining area, full kitchen, and a half bath. Our favorite area is the kitchen; the adults can chat and sip beverages while watching the littles in the living room all while enjoying your favorite sports game or entertaining your kids with their favorite show. TVs come equipped with YouTubeTV, Disney+, PrimeTV, & Netflix. Additional apps can be added with your discretion. Our full kitchen has a gas stove, refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, toaster, drip coffee maker, blender, mixer and basic kitchen utensils. There are French doors from the kitchen that lead you out to our fully fenced-in yard that also includes a deck with a grill and additional seating. We recommend sitting on the deck at night with the string lights on. The dining room table is located just behind the second common space and to the side of the kitchen. A table leaf is located in the closet if additional seating is needed. We recently added a pop-a-shot for older kids (and adults!) to enjoy too.<br /><br />The house sleeps up to 16 guests. All beds are located upstairs; 4 beds and a crib on the second floor and 4 beds on the third floor. We take comfort seriously, therefore you will find king beds in each bedroom and an additional king bed on the third floor/attic space. There is comfortable down-bedding and plenty of pillows. The attic offers an additional area that is perfect for an air mattress. It also includes an additional air conditioning unit for the summer months and a space heater for the winter. Although heat/air does flow to the attic, we want to ensure it stays comfortable for you as attics can be tricky. <br /><br />Families with small kids can appreciate that we keep a crib, highchair, bumbo, double stroller, sound machine, pack-n-play, infant tub seat, infant swing, infant play mat, and kids toys to help keep traveling light. There are additional kids' kitchen items such as bottle warmer, silverware, plates, bibs, and sippy cups. Additional items can be brought to the home upon request. If you would also like to bring your family dog, please request via message and this could be arranged for an additional fee. <br /><br />If you need early check-in or late check-out, please message me via Airbnb messaging to see if this option is available. I am generally pretty flexible, but also need to ensure I have enough turn-around time.<br /><br /><b>Guest access</b><br />Access through keypad entry with your own personal code through the front door. You will receive your code within 24 hours of your arrival date or sooner as well as detailed instructions to help navigate the house.<br /><br />There is plenty of free parking available across the street as street parking is not allowed on the side of the street closest to the house.<br /><br /><b>Other things to note</b><br />Before check-out, all trash must be placed inside a bag and discarded in the trash bin located in the front of the house near the large tree. Trash pick-up is on Thursday mornings. The trash bins can remain on the curb in the front of the house.<br /><br /><b>Registration Details</b><br />000029",16,9 beds,9,2.5 baths,Sleeps 16•Spacious•King Beds•Kid-Friendly•Walkable,Entire home/apt,Entire home/apt,111,"Bathtub; Hair dryer; Cleaning products; Shampoo; Conditioner; Body soap; Hot water; Shower gel; Free washer; Free dryer; Essentials; Hangers; Bed linens; Extra pillows and blankets; Room-darkening shades; Iron; Clothing storage: walk-in closet, closet, and dresser; HDTV with Hulu, Netflix, Apple TV, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video; Crib - always at the listing; Pack ’n play/Travel crib; Children’s books and toys; High chair; Baby bath; Children’s dinnerware; Board games; Baby safety gates; Children's playroom; Central air conditioning; Ceiling fan; Central heating; Exterior security cameras on property; Smoke alarm; Carbon monoxide alarm; Fire extinguisher; First aid kit; Wifi; Dedicated workspace; Kitchen; Refrigerator; Microwave; Cooking basics; Dishes and silverware; Freezer; Dishwasher; Stove; Stainless steel oven; Coffee maker: drip coffee maker; Wine glasses; Toaster; Baking sheet; Blender; Trash compactor; Barbecue utensils; Dining table; Coffee; Private entrance; Private patio or balcony; Private backyard – Fully fenced; Outdoor furniture; Outdoor dining area; BBQ grill; Free parking on premises; Free street parking; Pets allowed; Luggage dropoff allowed; Long term stays allowed; Self check-in; Keypad",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,111,46,40,6,2.41,4,33,33 Reviews in Q4,36,32.43,61,54.95,5,4.5,2,5.73E+17,39.78305,-86.13129,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,

You will be amazed with the houses in the neighborhood.<br />— <br />We are super laid back neighbors. <br />----<br />This duplex was built in 1890 and still has a lot of the original features. <br />----<br />We are located right by Mass Ave and Bottleworks, some of the most popular places in Indy. <br /><br />This house has a newly renovated, unique basement all done by Owners!<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />Welcome to our historic home built in 1890. We still have plenty of the original features combined with modern amenities. <br /><br />——-MAIN LEVEL——-<br />The main floor has a living room (card room, love seat, and TV), pool table, den (which has a queen bed), half bath, full kitchen, master bedroom (queen bed and TV) with an attached full bath, and access to a small concreted backyard area. <br /><br />——-BASEMENT——-<br />The basement has a bedroom (Queen bed), living room area (couch and TV), and laundry room (W/D).<br /><br />Things to note 📝<br />The den is not deemed a bedroom and has the least amount of privacy. You might hear little feet from above but we try to keep it to a minimum.<br /><br />Parking is FREE street parking in our neighborhood! If parking on the EAST side of the road (closest to house), you must have a parking permit. We have them inside the house for you. Please leave on your dash. West side of the road does not require a permit but it does get busy. We also have a spot in a gravel lot behind the house, which you would walk around to get in the front door. City life spills in and can take a lot of street spots on nice evenings so with the permits, we are hoping there’s a lot more parking available. This is a brand new thing for the neighborhood so we are unsure how often tags are being checked. <br /><br />$50 fee for replacement pass, if taken home or misplaced. Please do not take home 🙃.<br /><br />----<br /><br />🚗🚙 <br />Parking spot out back, if needed. Large vehicles may not be ideal as it’s a small gravel lot. <br /><br />Extra linens, hand towels, and bath towels are included with the space. <br /><br />There is a front porch where you can enjoy your morning coffee. We stock toilet paper, paper towels, dish soap, shampoo, conditioner, and laundry soap. Can’t find any?? Just send us a message!<br /><br />—————WHATS AROUND—————<br /><br />Walking distance to The Murat, Old National Center, The District Theatre, Mass Ave, Bottleworks, The Living Room Theatre, and plenty more. <br /><br />Short drive or Uber ride [~10 minutes] to Lucas Oil, Gainbridge, the Convention Center, The Children’s Museum, Indianapolis Zoo, White River Amphitheater, and more. <br />🏀🎤<br />If you’re going to a show or game on the Butler campus but want Indianapolis night life, we are in a great location.<br /><br /><b>Guest access</b><br />For the inquiring minds with this being a Duplex- You do not share anything but the front porch with the other side. You have the entire space listed. <br /><br />There’s a small gravel lot around the BACK of the house we can leave open for one vehicle if street parking isn’t for you. Some larger vehicles may not be ideal depending on length. As a reminder, you do have to walk around to the front door as there is no access to the large backyard. FREE STREET PARKING. Our neighborhood just recently issued parking passes to help with the evening congestion we sometimes have. <br /><br />****EAST SIDE OF THE ROAD (closest to house) REQUIRES PARKING PERMITS. WE CAN ISSUE UP TO TWO.**** This is a brand new process, so we are unsure how often they ticket/tow. West side (side opposite of house is available first come, first served basis).<br /><br />There’s a small fire hydrant at the end of the street, avoid parking along the yellow line.<br /><br />There’s a door in the kitchen that leads into a small backyard area with an outdoor trashcan you have access to. Most prefer the front porch when wanting fresh air.<br /><br /><b>Other things to note</b><br />There are cameras on site to monitor Front door, side alleys, and back alley/parking lot. We do monitor to make sure there are no parties on the property.

We just added the deck and hot tub, it is available year round. : ) Quiet and secluded, located in a rapidly transitioning neighborhood with rich history. Our Cottage is conveniently located within walking distance of highly acclaimed restaurants, coffee shops, a brewery and distillery. Situated just two blocks from the Monon Trail offering walking and biking access to more restaurants and shopping on Indy's famous Mass Avenue!<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />We just finished a complete rehab on our Cottage and we are excited for you to enjoy it as much as we do!

During your stay, participate in #porching, one of Indy's favorite pastimes, on your own private front porch. We are located directly across from the highly acclaimed Oaks Academy Middle School. There is free street parking available but keep in mind that the school dismissal is at 4:00. The pickup line gets pretty busy between 3:30 and 4:00. The Interstate is nearby, which means that at times you can hear it. It's slightly noticeable but not an annoyance. The street the cottage sits on, however, is delightfully quiet, aside from weekdays during school dismissal time. NOTE-there is a lot of development going on in the neighborhood. Lot's of new homes and condos being built all around the Cottage.

The listing was exactly as described, and communication was seamless. I felt a bit needy at times—like when we used the code on the wrong door—but they responded quickly and kindly. A water main break happened nearby, they were super helpful in confirming we weren’t in the water boil zone. We also noticed the dishwasher was open when we got home one night, which felt a little odd, but they promptly reassured us that it naturally opens after running. Sure enough, it happened again the next day—no big deal. Overall, a very pleasant stay!""*<br /><br />*""Our stay was great! They knew we were in Indianapolis for the Taylor Swift concert and left us a cute little welcome bag with bracelets and Taylor Swift goodies. Very personable and accommodating.* <br /><br />*""We really enjoyed staying here during our first visit to Indianapolis. The home was close to restaurants and downtown Indy.

The hardwood floors are original, they are safe, but not perfect. The home is intentionally decorated in a ""shabby chic"" like way....yes the portraits in the living room are supposed to be worn and torn. The home is professionally cleaned by Becht Pride Cleaning Service prior to each guest's arrival - the home is clean but was built in 1890....so it may seem ""worn"" to those who don't appreciate older homes. The linens are intentionally mismatched but again, clean and soft. There is a full kitchen but if you plan on preparing a multi-course meal, you may not have all the kitchen gadgets, etc. that you enjoy having in your own kitchen. Ask ahead of time or plan on bringing your favorite cooking utensils yourself. The furnace is new as of 2020 and the water heater as of 2018. The shower in the bathroom is in the original claw foot tub - clean but not pristine.

Stroll the brick lined streets of Irvington and discover the local shops, restaurants, and coffee houses.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />Originally constructed in the early 1900s, the Parker Lane house features beautifully restored hardwood floors, high ceilings, original wood trim and solid hardwood interior doors. Each space has been thoughtfully outfitted to make your stay comfortable, cozy, and relaxing. The house is designed to comfortably accommodate six guests.<br /><br />The main floor features an amply stocked kitchen, a coffee and tea nook, a mudroom with an in unit washer and dryer that guests can use during their stay, a full bathroom, a dining room set with six seats, a Crosley record turntable and a vinyl collection, a stack of fun, interactive board and card games, and a cozy, inviting living room set up with a 65 inch television - the perfect space to relax.<br /><br />Three upstairs bedrooms - including a master bedroom with a king bed and a desk, a trundle room with two twin beds, and a third room with a queen bed - are outfitted with memory foam mattresses that provide support and comfort. Each bedroom has a 55 inch TV, and we provide sound machines to promote restful sleep, helping soften the occasional trains that whistle at a nearby crossing, as well as other ambient city sounds. The second bathroom is thoughtfully stocked to make your stay more comfortable.<br /><br />Finally, there is a partially fenced in backyard that is shared with the other side of the duplex. The back lot includes two guest parking spaces, as well as a cozy fire pit area, complete with outdoor chairs and tables, lit with strings of suspended patio lights.<br /><br />Enjoy the walkability of Irvington - local restaurants, coffee houses, taprooms and cocktail lounges, shops and bookstores, are all just up the street from the home. Amble along the Pennsy Trail, pick up a robust coffee from Coal Yard, savor a slice of upper crust pizza from Jockamo’s, or try a hearty skillet breakfast at Lincoln Square. <br /><br />Downtown Indy is a mere 15 minute drive away - discover the fun shops and food offerings in Fountain Square, Mass Ave, the Bottleworks district, and enjoy a leisurely Canal walk. Whether you’re settling in for a weekend visit, planning to stick around to see the sights, or just passing through, the Parker Lane house is the perfect place for you to book while you’re in Indy!<br /><br /><br />ACCESSIBILITY //<br />The home was built in the early 1900s and some features were not originally designed with accessibility in mind. We've updated it to make it as comfortable as possible, but here are a few things you may want to note:<br /><br />1. There are 4 concrete steps leading to the entrance to the home. The last step is particularly tall.<br /><br />2. The bedrooms are all located on the 2nd floor of the home.
