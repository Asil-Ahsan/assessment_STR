PSG has 14 beds and we can hold 20 guests depending on sleeping configuration ! We have an amazing outside heated pool and spa, complete with a bar and 2 outside TV's. If you are there for the water, we have private water access right across the street for kayaks and paddleboards that we provide,. PSG is a mere 5-7 minutes away from the amazing Gulf beaches on Anna Maria Island, and 1 mile from a very nice tidal beach on Palma Sola Bay that would be great for toddlers.<br /><br />Our location couldn't be better no matter what your preference for food. Countless restaurants within a few minutes drive, and 2 grocery stores within a mile if you're staying in..<br /><br />For the fisherman, some of the best fishing around is right in front of our private Palma Sola Bay access. Local's and charter guides are there almost daily. Redfish, Sea Trout, Snook and Sheepshead patrol the shallows constantly. Ladyfish are very plentiful. Not a good eating fish, but good fighters on light/medium tackle. We have plenty of poles and basic tackle. Bait shops are near by. There are also 3 public access fishing spots within walking distance.<br /><br />For the golfers... Bradenton, Sarasota, and nearby Lakewood Ranch have plenty of excellent courses. You wont have to drive more that 40 minutes to get all the golf you can handle.<br /><br />For those traveling with small children we have you taken care of.

From time to time, they manage to get into the house. The reason for this is because they are searching for food or warmth. We remodeled the house from floor to the attic and sealed all possible breeding ground for pest and varmints. Our house is always clean. So, please help us maintain it that way. We have a recurring pest control service. So, if you see any pest in the house, don’t hesitate to let us know.

Thank you so much for your help with this.<br /><br />BUGS<br />Florida is a tropical place. We pay for pest control and they spray very often but please know there will occasionally be a bug found. Mosquitos can also be around usually in the evening, and more so after its rained. Lizards will be seen outside in the yard and sometimes on the screened in lanai. <br /><br />BUSY ROAD<br />We are very centrally located in Bradenton, you can get anywhere relatively quickly, because of this our road can get busy during rush hour.<br /><br />POOL SAFETY GATE<br />The yard is fenced in however, there is no fence going directly around the pool. Once exiting the home you go out into a screened in lanai area. From there you have to go out the screened lanai to get into the pool. Because there is not a fence directly around the pool!

This beautiful home with large, newly heated saltwater pool sits on a deep, salt water canal with a boat dock.<br /><br />This home is a mid-century treasure with a split layout, large fully equipped kitchen, two living areas conjoined into one open space, a beautiful pool on the canal, and a huge screened in lanai with outdoor furniture and dining table.

Guests DO NOT have access to this boat. Guests can bring boats to dock up here, but please note that there is a small part of the dock that is available for guests to dock their own boats. Being a small portion of the dock, we do not recommend that boats over 20' dock up here. <br /><br />***5 minute drive (2.5 miles) from Bradenton public beach!<br /><br />***Pool has the option to be heated for $15/day. Please let the hosts know ahead of time if you would like to use the heater during your stay.<br /><br />The home is listed as ""sleeps 8"" because there are three bedrooms, with bed space for 2 per room, and then the living room has a pullout couch for two more to sleep comfortably. Linens, pillows, and blankets for this pull out bed are provided in the hallway linen closet. <br /><br />This home has a pool on a canal, and there is very little space between the pool deck and drop off to the dock.

No extra charge for pool heater. We set a pool heater for 82-85 F degrees. Pool heater may raise the temperature by 20-25 degrees at most as long as the outside temperature remains above the 60F. When the outdoor temperature drops below 45 F pol heater operation is not possible as not enough heat in the air to warm the pool. The warmer the air and the more humid the air, the more heat is available for heating your pool. The ideal or rated condition for the heat pump is 80F air temperature, 80% relative humidity, and 80F water temperature. Under ideal conditions, heat pump should raise your pool temperature 1 F. per hour.

Surrounded by lush, tropical outdoor spaces, it’s the perfect place to unwind and soak up every golden ray.<br /><br />To help keep your stay comfortable and critter-free, we kindly ask that doors and windows stay closed. Our home receives regular professional pest and maintenance care, but in this vibrant tropical setting, you may still spot an occasional little visitor indoors or out — just a small reminder that you’re surrounded by Florida’s lively natural beauty.<br /><br />Our pool is professionally cared for with twice-weekly cleanings and inspections, keeping it sparkling and ready for your enjoyment. Because the pool area is open and surrounded by lush Florida greenery, you may notice a leaf or two drifting in between landscaping and pool visits — it’s all part of the relaxed, tropical Florida vibe!

Shout for help.<br />5. Pull the child out of the water.<br />6. Stay with the child and dial 911 (or the local emergency number) for help.<br />7. Check the airway and breathing. If needed, start CPR immediately (if you are trained)<br /><br />GUEST VERIFICATION:<br />To ensure a smooth and secure stay, we require the primary guest listed on the reservation to complete a simple screening process within 48 hours of booking confirmation. Please note that your reservation is not confirmed until these steps are completed.<br /><br />Once verified, and prior to check-in, guests will be asked to sign a Rental Agreement that includes:<br />- Agreeing to our rental terms and conditions.<br />- Providing a valid government-issued ID and a matching credit card before check-in.<br />- Paying a non-refundable $60 damage waiver. The damage waiver provides coverage for accidental damage during your stay, as long as it is reported prior to your check-out. This is collected either at the time of payment through the booking platform or afterward, depending on which platform you use to book.<br /><br />The damage waiver covers accidental damage that may occur during your stay. To ensure coverage, all damage must be reported promptly while you’re still at the property. We understand there is normal wear and tear at houses but should anything accidentally break or get stained during your stay please just let us know. Thank you!",9,5 beds,5,2 baths,Resort Yard!

To turn it on/off, just use the control box on the lanai. Please remember to switch it off when you’re done (or let it time out on its own).<br /><br />The pool is heated during the cooler months, but keep in mind—it’s not meant to feel “hot,” just comfortable. The spa is your go-to if you’re craving that toasty soak.<br /><br />Pool heat only runs when the pump is on (you’ll see water flowing from the spa to the pool). If the hot tub is on, pool heating pauses during that time.<br /><br />A pool company comes by twice a week to keep things clean, but this is Florida—some leaves might still float in. We’ve got a skimmer you can use if you feel like it.<br /><br /><br />We’ll follow up with a short online registration once you book. It’s fast, simple, and helps us prepare for your visit.<br /><br />For extra flexibility, consider adding trip insurance for a nominal fee.

Cleaning utensils and grill cleaner products are provided in the coffee bar bottom drawer.<br /><br />Baby Gear:<br /><br />We provide baby gear (pack and play & highchair) free of charge. It can be found in the closet of the third bedroom (king bed) located on the west side of the house.<br /><br />Games and Entertainment:<br /><br />Board games are located in the living room TV stand. Additionally, indoor and outdoor games for kids and adults are available and can be found in the laundry half bathroom.<br /><br />Welcome Package:<br /><br />To start your stay off right, we provide samples of local coffee, tea, sugar, cream, and toiletries upon your arrival. Laundry detergent, dishwasher pods, dish soap, trash bags, and toilet paper are also provided.<br /><br />Extra supplies may need to be purchased based on usage and length of stay.<br /><br />Pool Information:<br /><br />The pool is heated to 80 degrees at no extra cost, which is an acceptable swimming temperature. However, if you prefer a warmer pool, for an additional $30 per night, we can heat it to 86 degrees. This fee helps us keep our nightly rate low for guests who choose not to heat the pool and helps offset the additional energy costs.<br />It's highly recommended to heat the pool if you plan to swim during fall, winter, and spring months (typically mid-October through early May); however, the pool heater is assisted by the hot Florida sun and temperatures can reach into the mid-80s when set to heat to 80. If you would like to experience the warmer extra-fee-based option, please let us know in advance as it can take 12-24 hours to reach the desired temperature. You'll be charged for each night of your stay to maintain the temperature. Cold spells may impact the pool heater's ability to keep the desired temperature. Unfortunately, we do not offer refunds due to weather conditions or other factors beyond our control.<br /><br />While we have a professional service that cleans and maintains the pool weekly, we do not provide 24/7 pool maintenance. It may be necessary for guests to use the provided net to remove debris or other items that may fall into the pool before use. This is no different from what a homeowner would do, and our net is located adjacent to the pool deck. The pool is serviced on Mondays and Thursdays between 10am and 2pm and it typically takes 10-20 minutes to complete the job. Nemo's Pools will access the home through the gate to the backyard. Please allow them to clean the pool, and refrain from swimming during that time. Feel free to re-enter the pool as soon as they are finished.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: Please note that there is no safety fence nor alarms separating the pool from the home, so extra supervision of young children will be necessary. Make sure to review pool rules (see welcome guide) and take all necessary precautions before use.",13,7 beds,7,2.5 baths,4BR Oasis w/Pool & Firepit – Near AMI & IMG,Entire home/apt,Entire home/apt,59,Pool view; Hair dryer; Cleaning products; Shampoo; Conditioner; Body soap; Hot water; Shower gel; Washer; Dryer; Essentials; Hangers; Bed linens; Extra pillows and blankets; Room-darkening shades; Iron; Drying rack for clothing; Mosquito net; Clothing storage; TV; Sonos Bluetooth sound system; Books and reading material; Pack ’n play/Travel crib - always at the listing; Children’s books and toys; Folding or convertible high chair - always at the listing; Children’s dinnerware; Board games; Air conditioning; Ceiling fan; Heating; Exterior security cameras on property; Smoke alarm; Carbon monoxide alarm; Fire extinguisher; First aid kit; Wifi; Dedicated workspace; Kitchen; Refrigerator; Microwave; Cooking basics; Dishes and silverware; Mini fridge; Freezer; Dishwasher; Stove; Oven; Hot water kettle; Coffee maker; Wine glasses; Toaster; Baking sheet; Blender; Rice maker; Barbecue utensils; Dining table; Coffee; Bread maker; Private entrance; Laundromat nearby; Private patio or balcony; Backyard; Fire pit; Outdoor furniture; Hammock; Outdoor dining area; BBQ grill; Beach essentials; Sun loungers; Free parking on premises; Pool; EV charger - level 2; Single level home; Long term stays allowed; Self check-in; Smart lock; Cleaning available during stay,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,59,21,20,1,2.81,2,22,22 Reviews in Q2,30,50.85,25,42.37,0,0,2,1.10E+18,27.4814687,-82.6070393,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,

The little touches, like makeup towels in the bathroom & extra towels/paper products & soaps were so appreciated. The kitchen was extremely well stocked. Everyone thought the beds & pillows were wonderful. Decor was so lovely and well done. The kids had a blast in the heated pool (lighted at dark) and loft area upstairs, complete with large, comfortable family sectional to watch movies and play video games.

Venture out by land or by sea, with beaches just a quick drive away and direct canal access by boat from the private dock.

Underneath the adjacent tropical gazebo, you'll find the Blackstone griddle and outdoor dining table ideal for hosting an intimate cookout or sipping a frozen cocktail while listening to the pool spa's cascading fountain. If you need a little shade without sacrificing the sunshine, hang out in the lounge area on the screened porch for the best of both worlds.

It is located on 4th street, which is the most popular street in the area for walking, biking or jogging. Everyone is very pleasant as they stroll the neighborhood. Little Blue House Palmetto has three bedrooms upstairs, two of the bedrooms have direct access to the huge second floor balcony that has gorgeous views of the water. Having coffee in the morning as the sun comes up or a glass of wine watching the sunset over the river is something that cannot be properly captured in a picture or description. The kitchen is perfect for entertaining. Cooking with natural gas is a huge plus for those who are culinary experts. The tankless hot water heater is an added bonus with larger parties. Never having to worry about running out of hot water is great, especially if you’re the last one to get a shower that day. In addition to a wonderful house, the property is excellent for multiple families. The driveway is huge and can hold at least six cars or an RV or boat if you are traveling with one. There is a public boat ramp 5 minutes(or less) away and can handle launching even the biggest boats. Great restaurants are also close to this property which makes dining out a breeze. If you enjoy being active on your trip, this house is also located within a few miles of Emerson point which is perfect for riding bikes, beach BBQ or trail hikes with historic preserves.<br /><br /><b>Other things to note</b><br />Unique benefits to the property: gorgeous water views from the balcony, beautiful historic home, space for trailered boat or RV, active neighborhood with bikes available upon request, kayak available upon request, gas stove, tankless hot water heater, front porch swing.",6,4 beds,4,2.5 baths,Charming Historic Home In Palmetto,Entire home/apt,Entire home/apt,50,River view; Bathtub; Hair dryer; Cleaning products; Hot water; Washer; Free dryer – In unit; Essentials; Bed linens; Extra pillows and blankets; Iron; Clothing storage: closet; HDTV; Books and reading material; Crib; Pack ’n play/Travel crib; Children’s books and toys; Children’s dinnerware; Board games; Central air conditioning; Ceiling fan; Portable fans; Heating; Smoke alarm; Carbon monoxide alarm; Fire extinguisher; First aid kit; Wifi; Dedicated workspace; Kitchen; Refrigerator; Microwave; Cooking basics; Dishes and silverware; Freezer; Dishwasher; Stove; Oven; Coffee maker: drip coffee maker; Wine glasses; Toaster; Baking sheet; Dining table; Private entrance; Laundromat nearby; Private patio or balcony; Private backyard – Not fully fenced; Outdoor furniture; Outdoor dining area; BBQ grill: charcoal; Bikes; Free parking on premises; Luggage dropoff allowed; Long term stays allowed; Self check-in; Lockbox,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,50,43,27,16,1.16,3,19,19 Reviews in Q3,9,18,8,16,0,0,7,5.58E+17,27.51454,-82.58669,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,

You don't have to be a binocular-toting bird watcher to enjoy the flocks of bright green parrots that make this neighborhood their home. Their loud cries make them particularly noticeable, but loads of other feathered creatures flock here as well, including the occasional roseate spoonbill, ospreys and hawks searching for their next meal, pileated woodpeckers, and even the occasional bald eagle!<br /><br />The charm starts even before you reach the front door, with unique tropical plantings lining the path to a deck filled with colorful Adirondack chairs, the perfect spot for gathering for a drink. Inside the house, you'll find a large living room with loads of comfortable seating where the whole family can stream movies or play games. Kids might want to slip off to the large twin bedroom on one side of the kitchen; its generous floor is a great place for games or puzzles, or they can stream their own programs on the smart TV.<br /><br />Time for some rest? That twin bedroom also has two twin trundles that pull out easily at bedtime. Two other bedrooms are nestled on the other side of the living room. One features a king-size bed, and the other offers two queen beds and an ensuite bathroom with a walk-in shower. A second bathroom is located outside these two bedrooms and is easily reached from the twin room.<br /><br />The retro eat-in kitchen, which is well-equipped for preparing family meals and snacks, is open to the living room. However, you'll probably want to do most of your cooking outsidewith a gas grill, a Big Green Egg, and a smoker, cooking and dining al fresco is a natural choice!

The big above-ground pool has plenty of room for everyone, and can be heated for an additional charge. You can also swim in the crystal clear waters of the Gulf of Mexico, just across the Cortez Bridge. In between you'll find restaurants, shops, and even the free Anna Maria Island Trolley that runs from Coquina Beach in Bradenton Beach all the way up to the Historic Anna Maria Pier in the village of Anna Maria.<br /><br />This wonderful Florida home sleeps 10 people in one king, two queens, two twins, and two twin trundles. Need to sleep a few more?

If your reservation is for a longer period, someone on our staff will adjust the pool heat rate to reflect the longer stay.

Take a load off out back at the pool, take our bikes down the road to beautiful white sand beaches. All your cooking needs can be met between the beautiful chef's kitchen or grill on the pool patio.<br /><br />The standard pricing is for the first two guests. We understand large families or multiple guests may want to stay, and that is perfectly fine! Please make sure you include the correct number of guests for your reservation. If only booking for one guest, the master bedroom only will be set up and access to other rooms will not be available unless paid for. Prices are intentionally kept low to make affordable for one guest and when calculated with a full house, set to the normal price.<br /><br /><b>Guest access</b><br />Everything! The place is all yours :)<br />Outdoor grill on pool patio (guest provides propane), heated saltwater pool (during cold weather months) and additional sitting area to relax.<br />Have fun and games using the mini golf holes and corn hole on the artificial turf.<br /><br /><b>Other things to note</b><br />We want you to have the perfect stay. Let us know if there's anything missing and we will make sure to get it for you!<br /><br />Please note regarding the heated pool. To have accurate expectations, reading this message is necessary. The pool is heated during cool months, not the summer. Usually, October - May the pool is heated. Also of importance, this is a heated pool and NOT a hot tub. The water will never be hot, it will be warm. Temperature is set to 85 degrees. If by chance the weather is extremely cold, pool temperature may not reach 85 degrees. In short, if it’s very cold it’s not likely a time you’ll want to be swimming as again, this is not a hot tub. <br />Pool heater does not run 24/7. It runs 10 hours a day, per pool pump and heater regulations and standards. If you are trying to swim at 10:00 at night, the pool will not actively be heating and will remain at or near the set temperature. <br /><br />If you are interested in heating outside of these standards, additional heating can be provided at $25 a day. Advanced notice will need to be given and payment collected for your stay. <br /><br />Everything mentioned is standard practice for a heated pool. This is not to deter guests, but over recent years, guests expectations have become unreasonable and unrealistic <br />If your expectations for the pool are anything other than what is listed below, please contact me to set up the cost for additional heating, or feel free to book elsewhere.<br /><br />Regarding the pool, there are a couple robots that help with leaves falling from the neighbor’s yard. <br /><br />The one robot swims at the top and is powered with solar. You can turn off and take out as you wish. There’s a switch in the back to do so. <br />There is another robots that crawls on the bottom is wireless and charges with the charger on the back. It works better when the pool pump is not running at night time. It is in the outside covered area, with its charger. There is a green plug cover that you pull out to recharge it. That must be covered back up before putting in the pool. Please make sure you do that part before putting in the water or it will cause damage. Guest will be responsible if item is damaged as it costs over $1,000 and instructions are clearly listed. <br /><br />To turn it on, simply change the dial where the power button is. You rotate the dial to select the various modes. Just put it on the pool floor mode, the icon located at the 6 o’clock position.<br /><br />Keeping leaves out of the pool will be necessary for long term guests as it will block the filter and prohibit the filter from working.",8,3 beds,3,2 baths,Heated saltwater pool home - turf putting green,Entire home/apt,Entire home/apt,357,"Bathtub; Hair dryer; Cleaning products; Shampoo; Conditioner; Hot water; Shower gel; Free washer – In unit; Free dryer – In unit; Essentials; Hangers; Bed linens; Extra pillows and blankets; Room-darkening shades; Iron; Clothing storage: walk-in closet; Ethernet connection; 65 inch HDTV with Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Apple TV, standard cable, Hulu, Disney+, Roku, HBO Max; Mini golf; Paid pack ’n play/travel crib - available upon request; Booster seat high chair - always at the listing; Central air conditioning; Indoor fireplace: wood-burning; Ceiling fan; Portable fans; Heating; Exterior security cameras on property; Smoke alarm; Carbon monoxide alarm; Fire extinguisher; First aid kit; Wifi; Dedicated workspace; Kitchen; Refrigerator; Microwave; Cooking basics; Dishes and silverware; Freezer; Dishwasher; GE stainless steel electric stove; Oven; Hot water kettle; Coffee maker: drip coffee maker, Keurig coffee machine; Wine glasses; Toaster; Baking sheet; Blender; Barbecue utensils; Dining table; Private entrance; Laundromat nearby; Private patio or balcony; Private backyard – Fully fenced; Outdoor furniture; Hammock; Outdoor dining area; BBQ grill; Beach essentials; Bikes; Kayak; Sun loungers; Free parking on premises; Free street parking; Private outdoor pool - available all year, open 24 hours, heated, saltwater; Single level home; Luggage dropoff allowed; Long term stays allowed; Self check-in; Keypad",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,357,84,79,5,4.25,2,118,118 Reviews in Q2,69,19.33,54,15.13,19,5.32,2,30790356,27.48058,-82.64078,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,

Recently updated backyard with artificial turf and a two hole putting green. <br />Three bedroom, two bathroom, heated pool home with sidewalk access to ride bikes to the beach (3 miles away). Spread out in the backyard with 1/4 acre of land and your own private, heated pool. <br />Please review the listing and ask any questions you may have! We look forward to hosting you.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />This is the vacation home you're looking for. Take a load off out back at the pool, take our bikes down the road to beautiful white sand beaches. All of your cooking needs can be met between the beautiful kitchen or grill that's outside. <br /><br />The standard pricing for the rental is for the first two guests. We understand large families or multiple guests may want to stay, and that is perfectly fine! Please make sure you include the correct number of guests for your reservation. Prices are intentionally kept low to make affordable for one or two guests and when calculated with a full house, set to the normal price. If you intend on booking for 2 and using all bedrooms, you will be found out and charged an excessive fee accordingly. <br /><br />The gas grill and fire pit table propane tanks are the responsibility of guests. This includes cleaning the grill and filling the propane tanks. As some guests may want to use a full tank of propane while sitting at the fire pit table, propane cannot reasonably be provided by the host. Propane can be filled at the ACE Hardware that is located in the neighborhood for less than $25. If you intend to use the grill or fire pit, please ensure the propane tank is full. Please do not switch tanks between the grill and fire pit to prevent having to fill it. They should not be moved. If renting the home specifically for having a grill, please choose elsewhere as we provide the amenity but everything else is the responsibility of the guest. As guests have been problematic with the propane and grill, this is the result. We strive to make all accommodations for guests, but being a propane refill service is not manageable for the host.<br /><br /><b>Guest access</b><br />Everything! The place is all yours, no other parties will be in the home for your stay. <br /><br />A four digit code will be provided for you during your stay, using the last 4 digits of your phone number.<br /><br />No parties, no loud music at night, and do not bring more guests than you're booking for. This is monitored due to abuse. Please respect the house rules and we ensure you’ll have an amazing time.<br /><br /><b>Other things to note</b><br />We want you to have the perfect stay. Let us know if there's anything missing and we will make sure to get it for you!<br /><br />Please note regarding the heated pool. To have accurate expectations, reading this message is necessary. The pool is heated during cool months, not the summer. Usually, October - April the pool is heated. Also of importance, this is a heated pool and NOT a hot tub. The water will never be hot, it will be warm. Temperature is set to 85 degrees. If by chance the weather is extremely cold, pool temperature may not reach 85 degrees. In short, if it’s very cold it’s not likely a time you’ll want to be swimming as again, this is not a hot tub. <br />Pool heater does not run 24/7. It runs 10 hours a day, per pool pump and heater standards and standards. If you are trying to swim at 10:00 at night, the pool will not actively be heating and will remain at or near the set temperature. Do not attempt to change the pool temperature. A $500 fee will be assessed due to the possibility of ruining the heater. <br /><br />If you are interested in heating outside of these standards, additional heating can be provided at $25 a day. Advanced notice will need to be given and payment collected for your stay. <br /><br />Everything mentioned is standard practice for a heated pool. This is not to deter guests, but in recent years, guests expectations have become unreasonable and unrealistic. <br />If your expectations for the pool are anything other than what is listed below, please contact me to set up the cost for additional heating, or feel free to book elsewhere. <br /><br />The pool is cleaned and maintained professionally once a week, with visits usually occurring on Thursday. There is no set time for the pool company and they will enter via the side gate for scheduled maintenance.<br /><br />There is some road noise from Cortez Road. Noise machines are provided and can be used for anyone sensitive to noise while sleeping or those who prefer a noise machine!",8,3 beds,3,2 baths,Vacation home heated pool Turf yard putting green,Entire home/apt,Entire home/apt,394,"Hair dryer; Cleaning products; Shampoo; Conditioner; Body soap; Hot water; Shower gel; Free washer – In unit; Free dryer – In unit; Essentials; Hangers; Bed linens; Extra pillows and blankets; Room-darkening shades; Iron; Clothing storage: walk-in closet, closet, and dresser; Ethernet connection; 65 inch HDTV with Hulu, Roku, Netflix, Apple TV, HBO Max, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, DVD player; Mini golf; Pack ’n play/Travel crib; Board games; Babysitter recommendations; Central air conditioning; AC - split type ductless system; Ceiling fan; Portable fans; Heating; Exterior security cameras on property; Smoke alarm; Carbon monoxide alarm; Fire extinguisher; First aid kit; Wifi; Dedicated workspace; Kitchen; Refrigerator; Microwave; Cooking basics; Dishes and silverware; Mini fridge; Freezer; Dishwasher; GE stainless steel electric stove; Oven; Hot water kettle; Coffee maker: drip coffee maker; Wine glasses; Toaster; Baking sheet; Blender; Barbecue utensils; Dining table; Private entrance; Laundromat nearby; Private patio or balcony; Private backyard – Fully fenced; Fire pit; Outdoor furniture; Private outdoor kitchen; BBQ grill; Beach essentials; Bikes; Sun loungers; Free residential garage on premises – 2 spaces; Free street parking; Private outdoor pool - available all year, open 24 hours, heated; Single level home; Long term stays allowed; Self check-in; Keypad",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,394,91,88,3,4.33,2,129,129 Reviews in Q2,97,24.62,36,9.14,26,6.6,2,24245553,27.46134,-82.65556,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,

The combination of high water temperatures and deep water can pose significant risks.<br />Time Limit:<br />Prolonged exposure to hot water can cause dizziness or heat stroke. Guests should limit their soaking time to 15-20 minutes and take a break before re-entering the spa.<br />Temperature Control:<br />The hot tub temperature should never exceed 104 degrees Fahrenheit, as recommended by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.<br />No Glassware:<br />To avoid potential injury, glass containers should never be allowed near or in the hot tub. Plastic or shatterproof containers should be used instead.<br />Cleanliness:<br />Guests should always shower before using the hot tub to remove any lotions, oils, or other substances that could affect water quality.<br />No Diving or Jumping:<br />Due to the relatively shallow depth of a hot tub, diving or jumping in could lead to serious injury. Make it clear to guests that they should enter and exit the hot bath tub carefully and calmly.<br />Limit on Occupancy:<br />Every hot tub has a maximum safe occupancy number based on its size. Guests should be informed of this limit to avoid overloading the hot tub, which can compromise its structure and filtration system, and also increase the risk of accidents.<br />No Electrical Appliances:<br />Any electrical devices, including phones, speakers, or laptops, should be kept at a safe distance from the pool or hot tub to avoid the risk of electric shock.<br />Pregnant Women Caution:<br />It is widely recommended that pregnant women consult with a healthcare professional before using a hot tub, as elevated body temperatures can pose risks during pregnancy.<br />Hydration:<br />Encourage guests to drink water before and after hot tub use to avoid dehydration, which can be heightened by the heat of the hot tub.<br />Proper Attire:<br />Guests should be advised to wear suitable swimwear that doesn’t compromise the water quality. Regular clothing or underwear can introduce detergents or contaminants to the water.<br />No Pets:<br />Pets should not be allowed to sit in the hot tub for their safety and to maintain water cleanliness.<br />Cover After Use:<br />Guests should be instructed to cover the hot tub after each use. This helps maintain water temperature, prevent debris and food from entering the tub, and acts as a safety measure to prevent unsupervised use.<br />Noise Control:<br />To respect the tranquility of the surrounding area or neighboring properties, a rule about maintaining a low noise level, especially during late hours, would be considerate.",5,3 beds,3,1 bath,Tropical Cottage w SPA near Anna Maria Island IMG,Entire home/apt,Entire home/apt,126,"Bathtub; Hair dryer; Shampoo; Body soap; Hot water; Shower gel; Free washer – In unit; Free dryer – In unit; Essentials; Hangers; Bed linens; Room-darkening shades; Iron; Clothing storage: closet and dresser; 50 inch HDTV with Roku, standard cable; Books and reading material; Life size games; Pack ’n play/Travel crib - available upon request; Board games; Central air conditioning; Ceiling fan; Central heating; Smoke alarm; Carbon monoxide alarm; Fire extinguisher; Wifi; Dedicated workspace; Kitchen; Refrigerator; Microwave; Cooking basics; Dishes and silverware; Freezer; Dishwasher; Stove; Oven; Coffee maker: drip coffee maker, Keurig coffee machine; Wine glasses; Toaster; Baking sheet; Blender; Trash compactor; Barbecue utensils; Dining table; Private entrance; Private backyard – Fully fenced; Outdoor furniture; Outdoor dining area; Private BBQ grill: charcoal; Beach essentials; Sun loungers; Free parking on premises; Private hot tub - available all year, open specific hours; Single level home; Pets allowed; Self check-in; Lockbox",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,126,43,41,2,2.93,3,37,37 Reviews in Q3,29,23.02,0,0,18,14.29,3,49996735,27.49806,-82.58888,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,

Your relaxation station awaits!<br /><br />PET INFORMATION<br />A pet fee of $165 applies to all reservations with a dog. This fee is added to your reservation cost at the time of booking and, depending on which booking site you use, may or may not show as a separate line item on your bill. The fee covers up to two dogs, up to 50 pounds each. Any additional dogs or dogs larger than 50 pounds must be cleared with the owner prior to reserving the property. Sorry, no cats, birds, reptiles, or rodents allowed.<br /><br />POOL INFORMATION:<br /><br />**If you want the pool heated or chilled for your visit, please read the following information and inform me in advance if you wish to heat the pool during your visit, as it takes anywhere from 12-24 hours for the water to reach the desired temperature, ensuring you can enjoy it throughout your stay.**<br /><br />>The pool heating fee is $30 per night of your stay, or $150 per full week. Additional discounts are available for stays of one month or longer. Spa heating is included with the pool heating fee. For guests who do not wish to heat the pool but do wish to use the spa, it can be heated separately for $15 per night of your stay or $80 per full week from October 1st through May 31st. There is no charge to heat the spa from June 1st through September 30th. <br /><br />> During the spring and summer months, the pool will remain naturally above 80 degrees (and often above 90). While this temperature suits many guests, for those seeking a temperature that's more conducive to extended play time and swimming laps, you have the option to chill the pool to a refreshing 79 degrees for the same $30 per night/$150 per week. <br /><br />> External factors such as weather may affect pool heater and chiller efficiency, and refunds cannot be provided for circumstances beyond my control. The pool heater will not work when air temperatures drop below 50 degrees, so rather than run the heater with no effect, it will turn off until the ambient temperature rises enough to allow it to work. <br /><br />> While the pool undergoes weekly professional maintenance, I do not offer round-the-clock service as you might find at a resort. You may need to use the provided net to remove any debris before using the pool. The pool service typically visits on Friday mornings, though their schedule is subject to external factors such as weather.<br /><br />> Guests staying longer than three days may need to add water to the pool to offset evaporation, which removes several hundred gallons per week during the summer. I provide a convenient hose connected to a timer to simplify the process, so all you'll need to do is put the end of the hose in the water and set the timer to start filling.<br /><br />> The door and windows leading out to the pool are equipped with individual alarms that can be activated in the event that young children are in your party. You are responsible for activating and monitoring these alarms during your stay; they will not be active when you arrive.<br /><br /><b>Guest access</b><br />Guests have access to the entire property other than a locked owner's pantry and linen closet in the house and a gated and locked outdoor utility/storage area next to the garage. Guests are not permitted to touch the Hayward Omnilogic pool control panel under any circumstances. Access to the house is controlled by a Schlage Encode keypad on the front door.

Both king bedrooms feature a smart TV, but family movie time can be enjoyed together in the living room. There's also a family room with seating for conversation or reading, and a game table ready for family competitions.<br /><br />The kitchen is packed with everything you need to prepare delicious meals, from a crock pot to a hand mixer and most things in between. Serve your meals in the dining room, or pop outside to dine al fresco at the poolside dining table.<br /><br />Speaking of outside, that's probably where you and your family will spend much of your time. The large, heated pool and patio area are great for enjoying your guest with chaises for sunning and a gas grill for barbequing. Feeling especially energetic? Bring your own equipment and set up a game of volleyball or badminton in the extra-large backyard. <br /><br />This area is a great place for bike riding, both around Village Green and a little further afield to places like Manatee County's GT Bray Park, where you can find things like disc golf, orienteering, and other cool outdoor activities. For more information, check out the Manatee County website at <br /><br />Shopping and restaurants are just a quick trip in any direction, and, of course, the beaches of Anna Maria Island are just a few minutes away!

Please note that the pool will not heat to 86° during cold fronts when temps drop down to the 50’s, 60’s or 70’s.<br />Tampering with pool equipment will result in fines.<br /><br />-Pet fee: this is a pet friendly home, but please inquire about pet fees as it ranges from what type of dog, size, breed, (non shed, hypo, etc.) and number of pets.<br /><br />-NO parties or large gatherings are allowed.

Parking available inside garage. This house was updated in 2023 with a large family space.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />You can enter through the garage or at the top of the stairs. You will receive a code before check in. If you arrive at night, look for the yard with blue lights in the palms. There are solar lights and a bright motion detector light outside. You will enter the open living/ kitchen area. The kitchen is well equipped and has plenty of space to make your favorite meals. You can enjoy cool, filtered water from inside the refrigerator.

It is the owner’s personal unit.<br /><br /><b>Other things to note</b><br />It is important that anyone other than an adult should be supervised in the swim spa. It is 4 feet deep! It is safer not to be in the spa alone. Do not use the spa if you have any medical condition that would cause harm. Do not use the spa if you have consumed alcohol for your own safety. <br /> Loosen the velcro straps before taking the cover off. <br />The cover is heavy and folds back in two parts. Fold back the back half first onto the 4 post holder. Then, fold back the other half. That way it stays off the ground and is easier to put the cover back on. The spa is professionally cleaned each Monday. Some leaves may fall in when the cover is taken off. There is a net in the garage if you would like to use it. You can adjust the temperature by holding down the temp button and moving it up or down. Then press it one more time and press the set button. The Aux button is for swimmimg resistance. It is a strong current for experienced swimmers. Please be careful getting in and out of the spa. Please use caution when going into the garage with wet feet. It gets slippery. There is a mat to dry feet on just inside the door. Please lower spa temperature to 88 degrees and cover it when you are finished using it. Please turn air conditioning up during the day when you are away. Please rinse off sandy beach equipment, shoes and feet.

This exquisite 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom retreat sleeps 8 and offers the perfect blend of relaxation and recreation.<br /><br /> Located mere minutes from the stunning Gulf beaches of Anna Maria Island, this property boasts a private pool and beautifully landscaped yard. The open living area features comfortable seating and a large SMART TV, while the recently updated kitchen is equipped with granite countertops, a breakfast bar, ...<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />...and a spacious dining area. A convenient laundry room with extra storage completes this ideal vacation haven. <br /><br />Out the patio doors, you'll find a beautiful screened-in heated pool with plenty of room for everyone to relax, in or out of the water. A large dining table and gas grill make dining al fresco easier and more fun than eating out! String lights hang around the cage for magical evening hours enjoying the warm air and even the warm water after the sun goes down.<br /><br />The patio area overlooks a charming waterway that lends to the ambiance. Although this waterway doesn't lead to open waters, it's a great spot for the kids to fish from the banks. You might also want to rent a paddle board and explore the waterway as it twists its way through the neighborhood; a shell ramp leading down to the water's edge would make it easy to launch.<br /><br />Off the living area, you'll find the bedroom wing, with three bedrooms that can sleep 8. The primary bedroom has a king bed and en suite bath with a garden tub (currently there is no shower in this bathroom, but plans are underway to add one). The second bedroom has a queen bed and the third bedroom has bunk beds with a twin bed on top and a full-size mattress below. There's also a twin pull-out cushion that would make a comfortable sleeping spot for a small child. All three bedrooms have smart TVs so everyone can watch their own programs. The shared bathroom has a beautiful, tiled walk-in shower and vessel sink.<br /><br />Another great feature of this vacation spot is the location. You are minutes from the beautiful beaches of Anna Maria Island where you can just plant your toes in the sand, or you can rent a boat, jet skis, kayaks, and paddleboards, or even go for a horseback ride in the waters of Palma Sola Bay! The Island abounds with wonderful places to eat and fun shopping. You can even park your car and just catch the free Anna Maria Trolley to explore anywhere on the Island.<br /><br />Closer still is Robinson Preserve, one of Manatee County's loveliest parks, with walking and bike trails, kayaking opportunities, and even an observation tower from which you can see for miles out to the Manatee River, Tampa Bay, and Anna Maria Island to the Gulf of Mexico. The DeSoto National Memorial is also close at hand, a treasure from the National Park Service that anyone who loves history and the Florida landscape should be sure to enjoy.<br /><br />Traveling with a larger group? Check out ""Live Oak Lodge,"" a gorgeous four-bedroom home just three minutes down the street, or Tranquil Haven, just around the corner in the same neighborhood. Both of these pool homes can sleep up to 8 people.<br /><br />AGAIN, PLEASE NOTE: While this is a waterfront home, the waterway is not accessible for boats, nor does it connect to open water. Casual fishing may be enjoyed from the bank.<br /><br />ALSO, PLEASE NOTE that the garage is currently unavailable for guest use.<br /><br />A NOTE ABOUT POOL HEAT: If you book online, your reservation will automatically populate with a pool heat charge for one week. If your reservation is for a longer period, someone on our staff will adjust the pool heat rate to reflect the longer stay. We recommend pool heat at this property, regardless of the time of year, as pools near shady trees stay cooler, even in the summer.<br /><br />While we know you love your furry friends, this property is not pet friendly. Please make other arrangements for your pets.<br /><br />Our Cancellation Policy: In order to protect our owners from loss of income, ALL MONIES PAID TOWARDS YOUR RESERVATION MAY BE NON-REFUNDABLE AFTER A CERTAIN DATE! FULL AND PARTIAL REFUNDS MAY BE GIVEN UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS.
